Hi! I'm Loren, a programmer who specializes in C++, Qt, and QML and dabbles in D.

I've written a few little apps, most notably [Heartless](https://github.com/LorenDB/Heartless). Furthermore, you may have seen my name in conjunction with an app or two that I've contributed to.

While you're here, let me plug some software that I use and enjoy:

- Linux.
- All sorts of [KDE](https://kde.org) stuff.
- [[Matrix]](https://matrix.org).
- [Opera](https://opera.com).
