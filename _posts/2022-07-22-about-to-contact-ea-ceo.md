# I'm going to email the CEO of [EA](https://ea.com)!

Recently, I played 3D Pinball Space Cadet on an old Windows XP machine. It got me going with nostalgia for the game.
After doing some research (if you're not familiar with the history of Pinball, see the 
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball) for a lot of fascinating information), I decided
that it would be a shame if the game never saw the light of day again.

Now, technically, Pinball is still alive and well. It apparently still runs on modern Windows; if you aren't on Windows,
there's a [project](https://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball) that decompiled Pinball, ported it to Dear Imgui and SDL,
and got it working on practically every OS you can think of, meaning that I can play Pinball on Linux. Yay!

However, the original Pinball is not opensource. Microsoft [attempted](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20181221-00/?p=100535)
to release and opensource Pinball some years ago, but were thwarted by the terms of the original deal with Cinematronics 
(the company that created the original Full Tilt! Pinball game). According to one of the original developers of the
Microsoft version of Pinball, [Cinematronics is now owned by EA](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28861353). Therefore,
I've decided to email EA to ask that they opensource Full Tilt! Pinball and rework the license deal with Microsoft
to allow opensourcing of 3D Pinball Space Cadet.

The unfortunate part is that EA doesn't have any publicly listed email addresses that are suitable for this sort of 
feedback. In fact, EA's user feedback is limited to questions about their current game selection. I'm not even a gamer,
so that really isn't going to work. Thankfully, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dawngate/comments/2lvab0/contact_ea_executive_director_andrew_p_wilson/)
has documented the email address of EA's CEO, so I'm just going to email him.

Why am I writing this? Mainly to prove that, if EA chooses to opensource Pinball, I really was the reason they did so.
Being paranoid, I decided that writing this article before emailing EA would prove that I was not just claiming to be
the person who triggered it.

So, we'll see what happens with Pinball. If I get a response from EA, I may come back and add an article about it. If 
they take Pinball opensource, you will definitely hear from me. :)
